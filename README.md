# NDBlog
This application allows you to create and post blog posts, and each post will have a button to "love it" or "do not love it" and remove it.
When a post has more "love it" than "do not love it" (loveIts> 0), it will be colored green, and conversely when loveIts <0, it will be colored red.

You can also sort posts by title, date or like. And all this in ascending or descending order.

Installation:
- download or clone the project
- at the root of the directory, execute: "npm install" to install all necessary modules to the functioning of the blog
- start the web server of the blog with "ng serve".

And here it is, the blog is available on "http: // localhost: 4200". To change port: "ng serve --port numberPort".

Good luck :)
